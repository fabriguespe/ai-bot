## 🙋🏻‍♀️ FAQs❓

### What should I do in the event my flight gets delayed or canceled?

Immediately contact @Caroline McGuire or @Ashley Bassett - we will help find you an alternative option

### How do I expense meals or Ubers on travel days?

We will be issuing each individual a Ramp card with $200 for travel days. We have an Ephemera Uber Business account to expense rides and please use your discretion for travel day meals/snacks/etc. Upon arrival, all meals per day are covered and snacks/beverages will be provided throughout the day. Anything outside these parameters - spa amenities, shopping, etc will be at your own expense.

### I want to fly in early and/or extend my trip! Will the company cover accommodations?

Ephemera will cover one arrival flight and one departure flight so the dates at which you travel are at your discretion. However, any additional nights at the hotel outside of the official offsite dates will be at your own cost.

### I’m feeling ill/exhausted and want to opt-out of an activity I signed up for - who should I contact?

We completely understand this is a full week of working sessions and breaks/time to regroup are necessary.

_If you are feeling ill or experiencing flu-like symptoms please stay in your room and take care of yourself - we will have Advil/ First-aid kit/etc if you need anything, just ask._
